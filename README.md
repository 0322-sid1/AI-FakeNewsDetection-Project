# 📰 AI-Powered Fake News Detection
## 📘 Project Overview

With the rapid spread of online information, fake news has become a serious social and informational threat.
This project develops an AI-based system that automatically detects and classifies news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of real and fake news to learn linguistic and semantic patterns associated with misinformation.

## 🎯 Objectives

Analyze linguistic patterns in real vs. fake news articles

Preprocess and clean text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)

Build ML and DL models for classification

Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 🧠 Model Development Workflow

Data Loading and Cleaning

Remove null values and duplicate records

Clean text using regular expressions and tokenization

Text Preprocessing

Stopword removal

Lemmatization or stemming

TF-IDF or CountVectorizer for text representation

Model Training

Tested multiple models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Naive Bayes

LSTM (optional deep learning model)

Model Evaluation

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix visualization
